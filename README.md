# ChatFCoin

This is a training project to build chatbot for Facebook with elixir and phoenix. `Genserver`, `DynamicSupervisor`, `Protocol` are used, and this project shows you how you can implement `mishka_installer` and make a project plugin-based.

> In this project, I tried to use at least ready library. For this reason, there is a lot of room for optimization for this project.

### Installation

It is a normal Phoenix project, and you can deploy on your system, but I prepared a simple docker for you.
